                                   Breaking Ground Dance Center has boys in different classes and age groups. What I like about this school is that the schedule and expectations are shared with everyone early and the bill includes photography and costumes.  The kids quickly welcome new comers. No drama or unnecessary competitiveness.  We tried a class and stayed. Additionally, they will have an expanded, renovated, space for all to enjoy including a homework/collaborative area <ion-icon name="heart"></ion-icon>
